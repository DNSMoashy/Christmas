                <p>This year many things have changed including my career path. 
                    So I thought what better way to practice this new path then
                    using my annual Christmas list and turning it into
                    an interactive web page!
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>To add to the interactivity and practice for myself I have composed links and 
                    sections with tables to make things easier and at the end I have
                    a form for you all to fill out based on your experience!

                <p>Now that you (I assume) have read through the top paragraph 
                    you can choose where to go next. If this is your first look at this
                    page you will want to click the middle button. After that 
                    you will go back and press the button with your name. If you are 
                    coming back to this page after all that, then there are navigation links below.
